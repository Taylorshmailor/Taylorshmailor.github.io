            I'm a computer science major with an interest in design. <br>
            <br>
            As a software engineer with a focus in front-end development, I'm passionate about user accessibility and designing applications to be as user-friendly as possible. 
            I also love working on software that somehow gives back to the community in some shape or form. <br>
            <br>
            In my free time, I enjoy hiking and hanging out with my cat. I even have a personal goal of trying to visit every national park in the U.S. <br>
            <br>
            It's nice to meet you!
