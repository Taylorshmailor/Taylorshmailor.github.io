                I'm a computer science major with an interest in design. <br>
                <br>
                As a software engineer with a focus in front-end development, I'm passionate about user accessibility and designing applications to be as user-friendly as possible. 
                I also love working on software that somehow gives back to the community in some shape or form. <br>
                <br>
                In my free time, I enjoy hiking and hanging out with my cat. I even have a personal goal of trying to visit every national park in the U.S. <br>
                <br>
                It's nice to meet you!

            "Taylor was the first intern I've ever mentored.
            <br>
            <br>
            Her project was to create an authentication system, both front and back end, for
            an internal website at IBM. Thanks to Taylor's successful work, we are now able to securely
            log our workers and retailers that we work with without jeopardizing sensitive information. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Taylor is a fast learner, and made being a mentor enjoyable the entire time. I hope I get the chance to work with her again in the future."

            "Taylor was my intern for the summer of 2020. Although she is not an electrical engineer, 
            she was put on our team to create software that would speed up data mining and analytics 
            for our motherboard database. <br>
            <br>
            Our time working together was short, but I could tell she was a hardworker and efficient at coding.
            I only wish the best for her and her career."

            In the time that she worked under me, she programmed an android application using OpenFace, an open source facial recognition software, to aid in our pilot
